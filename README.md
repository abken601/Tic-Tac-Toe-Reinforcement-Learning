# Tic-Tac-Toe-Reinforcement-Learning

This project tackles a classical game - Tic Tac Toe. Tic Tac Toe players on a 3x3 board and is well-known a "must-draw" game with an educated strategy. We demonstrate how this strategy can be trained with reinforcement learning method. The number of state of this game can be roughly estimated by 3^9 = 19683 states, a very good number for a normal desktop computer can afford to. We use three different reinforcement learning methods to train our strategy, namely, temporal difference (TD), Sarsa (SS) and Q-learning (QL).
